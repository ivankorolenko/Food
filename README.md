The project contains a lot of reusable modules such as main slider with tabs or script of modal window.

The application can get info about menu and post data from modal forms to server. To demonstrate this ability, project is set to [JSON-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), so if you are going to run this application on you computer you should run the JSON-server too.

The project is avlaible to see at [GitPages](https://ivankorolenko.github.io/Food/).

You also can clone this repository, install associated packages and run JSON-server by the next commands:

#### `$ git clone https://github.com/ivankorolenko/Food.git Food`
#### `$ cd Food`
#### `$ npm install`
#### `$ npx json-server db.json`

In this case you previously should become sure that <b>npm</b> is installed on you computer.
